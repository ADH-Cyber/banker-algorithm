 * Description:
 *  Simulates the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance by managing multiple customer 
 *  requests and releases for shared resources. The program checks for safe states using 
 *  the Safety Algorithm and ensures allocations do not lead to unsafe states that could 
 *  cause deadlock.

 * Compile using:
 *  gcc -o banker bankers_algorithm.c
